<p>This page is generated dynamically through <code>pasta.php</code> controller file in the controller folder. The page correspond to 3 parts, a header, a footer, and a main content from which you should dynamically update its content by calling the <code>put</code> function from the <code>pasta.php</code> controller. You could further extend this method to have more structure but document it well please.</p>
