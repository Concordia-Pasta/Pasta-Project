##### Announcement

- Removed the TEST branch, use only develop and master. Three branches seems to be hard to managed.
- Sorry I was toying with the commits and messed up the commit histroy - Charles.

##### Basic Workflow
- master branch should contains our most stable releases.
- develop branch should contains our infinished testing code. It is your duty to insure that whatever code your adding, that piece of code should be compatible with the rest of the other codes.
- topic branch(es) should be only created on your __local__ machine. Merge your final code into `develop` branch first, and then `push` it to the `develop` branch so other people can see it, test it, or modify it.

# Commit Messaging Guideline

First line: Summary of what you did. Do not use past-tense, use only present tense, ie. Upload instead of Uploaded, Add instead of Added, etc.

Second line: Space

Third line and plus: The detail message of your commit.

Please make sure that the commit message body and subject should not be wider than 80 characters wide. Its just a convention.
