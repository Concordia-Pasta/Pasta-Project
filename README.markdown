# Commit Messaging Guideline

First line: Summary of what you did. Do not use past-tense, use only present tense, ie. Upload instead of Uploaded, Add instead of Added, etc.

Second line: Space

Third line and plus: The detail message of your commit.

Please make sure that the commit message body and subject should not be wider than 80 characters wide. Its just a convention.
